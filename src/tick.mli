(** {1 Base MirageOS signatures}

    The following signatures are assumed to be part of MirageOS's signatures. *)


(** The type for POSIX time clocks.

    [PCLOCK] provides access to POSIX calendar time. This time is
    subject to operating system calendar time adjustement and can go
    back in time, it should not be used to measure wall-clock time
    spans. *)
module type PCLOCK = sig

  (** {1:posix POSIX time} *)

  val now_d_ps : unit -> int * int64
  (** [now_d_ps ()] is [(d, ps)] representing the POSIX time occuring
      at [d] * 86'400e12 + [ps] POSIX picoseconds from the epoch
      1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. [ps] is in the range
      \[[0];[86_399_999_999_999_999L]\]. *)

  val period_d_ps : unit -> (int * int64) option
  (** [period_d_ps ()] is if available [Some (d, ps)] representing the
      clock's picosecond period [d] * 86'400e12 + [ps]. [ps] is in the
      range \[[0];[86_399_999_999_999_999L]\]. *)

  val current_tz_offset_s : unit -> int
  (** [current_tz_offset_s ()] is the clock's current local time zone
      offset to UTC in seconds. *)
end

(** The type for monotonic time clocks.

    [MCLOCK] provides access to monotonic wall-clock time.  This time
    increases monotonically and is not subject to operating system
    calendar time adjustment. It can only be used to measure
    wall-clock time spans in a single program run. It will not
    correctly measure time spans across {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and
    {!LIFECYCLE.resume} events as the monotonic clock does not
    increase during these two events. *)
module type MCLOCK = sig

  (** {1:monotonic Monotonic time} *)

  type ns_span = int64
  (** The type for nanosecond precision time spans. This is an
      {e unsigned} 64-bit integer. It can measure up to approximatevely
      584 Julian years before (silently) rolling over. *)

  val elapsed_ns : unit -> ns_span
  (** [elapsed_ns ()] is the wall-clock time span elapsed since the
      beginning of the program. Note that this doesn't take into
      account time the program spends between two {!LIFECYCLE.suspend}
      and {!LIFECYCLE.resume} occurences.  *)

  val period_ns : unit -> ns_span option
  (** [period_ns ()] is if available [Some d] representing the
      clock's nanosecond period [d]. *)
end

(** The type for program life cycle events.

    [LIFECYCLE] provides the ability to watch important events
    occuring in the life time of the program. *)
module type LIFECYCLE = sig

  (** {1:events Events} *)

  type 'a event
  (** The type for life cycle events with payloads of type ['a]. *)

  type watcher
  (** The type for event watchers. *)

  val watch : 'a event -> ('a -> unit) -> watcher
  (** [watch e f] is a key-value watcher such that [f] is called whenever
      event [e] occurs. *)

  val unwatch : watcher -> unit
  (** [unwatch w] stops the watcher [w]. After that call it's callback
      is guaranteed not to be called again. *)

  val poweron : unit event
  (** [poweron] occurs shortly after the system powers up. *)

  val poweroff : unit event
  (** [poweroff] occurs shortly before the system is going to power off. *)

  val suspend : unit event
  (** [suspend] occurs shortly before the system is suspended. *)

  val resume : unit event
  (** [resume] occurs shortly after the system resumes after having been
      {!suspend}ed. *)
end

(** The type for mutable key-value stores.

    [KV] provides access to typed and named values. *)
module type KV = sig

  (** {1 Value codecs} *)

  type 'a codec = ('a -> string) * (string -> ('a, R.msg) result)
  (** The type for value codecs. An encoder and a decoder. *)

  exception Decode_error of string * R.msg
  (** The exception for key value decode errors. If [Decode (key,
      msg)] is raised it means that the store's data for [key] could
      not be decoded using the client's codec. This exception is not
      meant to be handled by programs, it indicates a configuration
      mismatch between the program and its environment. *)

  (** {1:key Keys} *)

  type 'a key
  (** The type for keys with values of type ['a]. *)

  val key : string -> 'a codec -> 'a key
  (** [key name codec] is a key with lookup name [name] and whose value
      is codec'd by [codec]. *)

  val key_name : 'a key -> string
  (** [key_name k] is [k]'s name. *)

  val key_codec : 'a key -> 'a codec
  (** [key_codec k] is [k]'s codec. *)

  val mem : 'a key -> bool
  (** [mem k] is [true] iff [k] is bound to a value of type ['a]
      in the key-value store. *)

  val find : 'a key -> 'a option
  (** [find k] is [k]'s binding in the key-value store (if any).

      @raise Decode_error in case of value decode error. *)

  val get : ?absent:'a -> 'a key -> 'a
  (** [get k] is [k]'s binding the key-value store. If [absent] is
      specified this value is returned if [k] is not bound in the store.

      @raise Invalid_argument if [k] is unbound in the key-value store
      and [absent] is not specified. TODO maybe unify that with
      Decode_error.

      @raise Decode_error in case of value decode error. *)

  val set : 'a key -> 'a option -> unit
  (** [set k v] sets the key value of [k] to [v]. *)

  (** {1:watch Watching keys} *)

  type watcher
  (** The type for key-value binding change watchers. *)

  val watch : 'a key -> ('a key -> 'a option -> unit) -> watcher
  (** [watch k f] is a key-value watcher such that whenever [key] is {!set} to
      [v], [f k v] is called. *)

  val unwatch : watcher -> unit
  (** [unwatch w] stops the watcher [w]. After that call it's callback
      is guaranteed not to be called again. *)
end

(** The type for clock ticks watchers.

    [WATCHER] provides a base signature for watching nanosecond
    precision clock ticks. *)
module type WATCHER = sig

  (** {1:watcher Tick watchers} *)

  type span_ns = int64
  (** The type for positive nanoseconds time spans. This is an {e unsigned}
      64-bit integer it can represent time spans up to approximatevley 584
      Julian years. *)

  type trigger
  (** The type for tick watcher triggers. This is the value being
      acted upon when a {{!t}watcher} sees a tick. *)

  type t
  (** The type for tick watchers. Encapsulate a delay to watch
      for and a trigger to actuate whenever the delay elapsed. *)

  val watch : delay_ns:span_ns -> trigger -> t
  (** [watch d tr] is a tick in that occurs after [d] nanoseconds and is
      watched by trigger [tr]. *)

  val unwatch : t -> unit
  (** [unwatch w] unwatches the tick in [w]. If [w] is no longer
      {!waiting} this has no effect. Otherwise [w]'s trigger is guaranteed
      not to be actuated and {!waiting}[ w] becomes [false]. *)

  val waiting : t -> bool
  (** [waiting w] is [true] iff [w]'s trigger has not been actuated yet
      or [w] was not {!unwatch}ed. *)

  val linger_ns : t -> span_ns
  (** [linger_ns w] is the number of nanoseconds during which {!waiting}[ w]
      was [true]. If [w]'s trigger was actuated then:
      {ul
      {- [linger_ns w < delay_ns w] the tick was in advance.}
      {- [linger_ns w = delay_ns w] the tick was on time.}
      {- [linger_ns w > delay_ns w] the tick was late.}} *)

  val delay_ns : t -> span_ns
  (** [delay_ns w] is [w]'s waiting delay. *)

  val trigger : t -> trigger
  (** [trigger w] is [w]'s trigger. *)

  val fold : ('a -> t -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a
  (** [fold f acc] folds over all watchers that have {!waiting }[ t = true]. *)
end

(** The type for unreliable, monotonic, clock ticks watchers.

    [UNRELIABLE] has the following properties. Given a watcher
    [w]:
    {ul
    {- If there is no {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event while
       {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true]. The value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.}
    {- Watcher triggers being {{!trigger}functions} they are not
       persisted and do not survive
       a {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} event.}}

    These properties are typically sufficient for watching small timeouts
    in protocol implementations.

    {b TODO.} Maybe this should be functorized over {!MCLOCK}. *)
module type UNRELIABLE = sig

  (** {1 Unreliable clock tick watchers} *)

  type t
  (** The type for unreliable watchers. *)

  type trigger = t -> unit
  (** The type for unreliable triggers. *)

  include WATCHER with type t := t and type trigger := trigger
end

(** {1 Ticking reliably} *)

(** The type for program suspension reliable, monotonic, clock tick
    watchers.

    [SUSPENSION_RELIABLE] has the following properties. Given
    a watcher [w]:
    {ul
    {- If there is no {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event while
       {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true], the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.}
    {- If there is one or more pairs of {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and
       {!LIFECYCLE.resume} events while {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true]
       and that the difference between the value of {!PCLOCK.now_d_ps}
       at these events provides an accurate measure of the actual wall-clock
       time span that elapsed during suspension, the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.

       This condition is typically satisfied if {!PCLOCK} is well synchronized
       at {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and {!LIFECYCLE.resume} and no leap second
       occurs between these two events. The absolute value of {!PCLOCK} doesn't
       matter.}
    {- Watcher triggers being {{!trigger}functions} they are not
       persisted and do not survive
       a {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} event.}} *)
module type SUSPENSION_RELIABLE = sig

  (** {1 Suspension reliable clock tick watchers} *)

  type t
  (** The type for suspension reliable watchers. *)

  type trigger = t -> unit
  (** The type for suspension reliable triggers. *)

  include WATCHER with type t := t and type trigger := trigger

end

(** Persistent triggers. *)
module type PERSISTENT_TRIGGER = sig

  (** {1 Triggers} *)

  type t
  (** The type for persistent triggers. *)

  val trigger : int64 -> int64 -> t -> unit
  (** [trigger d t tr] is called whenever a watcher's trigger needs to
      be triggered. [d] is the watcher's delay and [t] the actual
      lingering time. *)

  val codec : (t -> string) * (string -> (t, R.msg) result)
  (** [codec] is a byte codec for triggers. *)
end


(** The type for program poweroff reliable, monotonic, clock tick
    watchers.

    [POWEROFF_RELIABLE] has the following properties. Given
    a watcher [w]:
    {ul
    {- If there is no {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event while
       {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true], the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.}
    {- If there is one or more pairs of {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and
       {!LIFECYCLE.resume} events while {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true]
       and that the difference between the value of {!PCLOCK.now_d_ps}
       at these events provides an accurate measure of the actual wall-clock
       time span that elapsed during suspension, the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.

       This condition is typically satisfied if {!PCLOCK} is well synchronized
       at {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and {!LIFECYCLE.resume} and no leap second
       occurs between these two events. The absolute value of {!PCLOCK} doesn't
       matter.}
    {- If there is one or more pairs of {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} and
       {!LIFECYCLE.poweron} events and that the difference between
       the value of {!PCLOCK.now_d_ps} at these events provides an accurate
       measure of the actual wall-clock time span that elapsed during the
       poweroff, the value of {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and
       exact wall-clock time span.

       This condition is typically satisfied if {!PCLOCK} is well synchronized
       at {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} and {!LIFECYCLE.poweron} and no leap second
       occurs between these two events. The absolute value of {!PCLOCK} doesn't
       matter.}}
    In this interface triggers can be {{!PERSISTENT_TRIGGER}persisted}.
    Note that trigger actuation occurs through the {!PERSISTENT_TRIGGER}
    interface. *)
