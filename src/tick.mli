(** {1 Base MirageOS signatures}

    The following signatures are assumed to be part of MirageOS's signatures. *)

(** The type for POSIX time clocks.

    [PCLOCK] provides access to POSIX time and the system current time
    zone offset.

    This time does not increase monotically and is subject to system
    calendar time adjustements. It can go back in time, and as such
    should not be used to measure wall-clock time spans. *)
module type PCLOCK = sig

  (** {1:posix POSIX Clock} *)

  val now_d_ps : unit -> int * int64
  (** [now_d_ps ()] is [(d, ps)] representing the POSIX time occuring
      at [d] * 86'400e12 + [ps] POSIX picoseconds from the epoch
      1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. [ps] is in the range
      \[[0];[86_399_999_999_999_999L]\]. By definition this time
      is always on the UTC timeline.

      @raise Sys_error if the time can't be determined. This exception
      should only be catched at the toplevel of your program to
      log and it and abort the program. It indicates a serious error
      condition in the system. *)

  val period_d_ps : unit -> (int * int64) option
  (** [period_d_ps ()] is [Some (d, ps)], representing the
      clock's picosecond period [d] * 86'400e12 + [ps], if known.
      [ps] is in the range \[[0];[86_399_999_999_999_999L]\]. *)

  (** {1:tz System time zone offset} *)

  val current_tz_offset_s : unit -> int option
  (** [current_tz_offset_s ()] is the system's current local time
      zone offset to UTC in seconds, if know. This is the duration
      local time - UTC time in seconds. *)
end

(** The type for monotonic time clocks.

    [MCLOCK] provides access to monotonic wall-clock time.  This time
    increases monotonically and is not subject to operating system
    calendar time adjustment. It can only be used to measure
    wall-clock time spans in a single program run. It will not
    correctly measure time spans across {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and
    {!LIFECYCLE.resume} events as the monotonic clock does not
    increase during these two events. *)
module type MCLOCK = sig

  (** {1:monotonic Monotonic time} *)

  type ns_span = int64
  (** The type for nanosecond precision time spans. This is an
      {e unsigned} 64-bit integer. It can measure up to approximatevely
      584 Julian years before (silently) rolling over. *)

  val elapsed_ns : unit -> ns_span
  (** [elapsed_ns ()] is the wall-clock time span elapsed since the
      beginning of the program. Note that this doesn't take into
      account time the program spends between two {!LIFECYCLE.suspend}
      and {!LIFECYCLE.resume} occurences.  *)

  val period_ns : unit -> ns_span option
  (** [period_ns ()] is if available [Some d] representing the
      clock's nanosecond period [d]. *)
end

(** The type for monotonic clock ticks. *)
module type MTICK = sig

  (** {1 Tick tock} *)

  type ns_span = int64
  (** The type for nanosecond precision time spans. This is an
      {e unsigned} 64-bit integer. It can measure up to approximatevely
      584 Julian years before (silently) rolling over. *)

  val tock : delay_ns:ns_span -> (ns_span -> unit) -> unit
  (** [tock d f] calls [f t] in [d] monotonic nanosecond with
      [t] the number of elapsed (measured using {!MCLOCK.elapsed_ns})
      between the call to [tock] and [f]'s invocation.

      {!MCLOCK} being used, [t] cannot be relied upon if
      a {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event occurs between the call to [tock]
      and [f]'s invocation. *)
end

(** The type for program life cycle events.

    [LIFECYCLE] provides the ability to watch important events
    occuring in the life time of the program. *)
module type LIFECYCLE = sig

  (** {1:events Events} *)

  type 'a event
  (** The type for life cycle events with payloads of type ['a]. *)

  type watcher
  (** The type for event watchers. *)

  val watch : 'a event -> ('a -> unit) -> watcher
  (** [watch e f] is a key-value watcher such that [f] is called whenever
      event [e] occurs. *)

  val unwatch : watcher -> unit
  (** [unwatch w] stops the watcher [w]. After that call it's callback
      is guaranteed not to be called again. *)

  val poweron : unit event
  (** [poweron] occurs shortly after the system powers up. *)

  val poweroff : unit event
  (** [poweroff] occurs shortly before the system is going to power off. *)

  val suspend : unit event
  (** [suspend] occurs shortly before the system is suspended. *)

  val resume : unit event
  (** [resume] occurs shortly after the system resumes after having been
      {!suspend}ed. *)
end

(** The type for mutable key-value stores.

    [KV] provides access to typed and named values. *)
module type KV = sig

  (** {1 Value codecs} *)

  type 'a codec = ('a -> string) * (string -> ('a, R.msg) result)
  (** The type for value codecs. An encoder and a decoder. *)

  exception Decode_error of string * R.msg
  (** The exception for key value decode errors. If [Decode (key,
      msg)] is raised it means that the store's data for [key] could
      not be decoded using the client's codec. This exception is not
      meant to be handled by programs, it indicates a configuration
      mismatch between the program and its environment. *)

  (** {1:key Keys} *)

  type 'a key
  (** The type for keys with values of type ['a]. *)

  val key : string -> 'a codec -> 'a key
  (** [key name codec] is a key with lookup name [name] and whose value
      is codec'd by [codec]. *)

  val key_name : 'a key -> string
  (** [key_name k] is [k]'s name. *)

  val key_codec : 'a key -> 'a codec
  (** [key_codec k] is [k]'s codec. *)

  val mem : 'a key -> bool
  (** [mem k] is [true] iff [k] is bound to a value of type ['a]
      in the key-value store. *)

  val find : 'a key -> 'a option
  (** [find k] is [k]'s binding in the key-value store (if any).

      @raise Decode_error in case of value decode error. *)

  val get : ?absent:'a -> 'a key -> 'a
  (** [get k] is [k]'s binding the key-value store. If [absent] is
      specified this value is returned if [k] is not bound in the store.

      @raise Invalid_argument if [k] is unbound in the key-value store
      and [absent] is not specified. TODO maybe unify that with
      Decode_error.

      @raise Decode_error in case of value decode error. *)

  val set : 'a key -> 'a option -> unit
  (** [set k v] sets the key value of [k] to [v]. *)

  (** {1:watch Watching keys} *)

  type watcher
  (** The type for key-value binding change watchers. *)

  val watch : 'a key -> ('a key -> 'a option -> unit) -> watcher
  (** [watch k f] is a key-value watcher such that whenever [key] is {!set} to
      [v], [f k v] is called. *)

  val unwatch : watcher -> unit
  (** [unwatch w] stops the watcher [w]. After that call it's callback
      is guaranteed not to be called again. *)
end


(** {1 Tick watchers}

    The following add a little bit more features to the base OS'
    monotonic ticks. *)

(** The type for clock tick watchers.

    [WATCHER] provides a base signature for watching nanosecond
    precision clock ticks. *)
module type WATCHER = sig

  (** {1:watcher Tick watchers} *)

  type span_ns = int64
  (** The type for positive nanoseconds time spans. This is an {e unsigned}
      64-bit integer it can represent time spans up to approximatevley 584
      Julian years. *)

  type trigger
  (** The type for tick watcher triggers. This is the value being
      acted upon when a {{!t}watcher} sees a tick. *)

  type t
  (** The type for tick watchers. Encapsulate a delay to watch
      for and a trigger to actuate whenever the delay elapsed. *)

  val watch : delay_ns:span_ns -> trigger -> t
  (** [watch d tr] is a tick in that occurs after [d] nanoseconds and is
      watched by trigger [tr]. *)

  val unwatch : t -> unit
  (** [unwatch w] unwatches the tick in [w]. If [w] is no longer
      {!waiting} this has no effect. Otherwise [w]'s trigger is guaranteed
      not to be actuated and {!waiting}[ w] becomes [false]. *)

  val waiting : t -> bool
  (** [waiting w] is [true] iff [w]'s trigger has not been actuated yet
      or [w] was not {!unwatch}ed. *)

  val linger_ns : t -> span_ns
  (** [linger_ns w] is the number of nanoseconds during which {!waiting}[ w]
      was [true]. If [w]'s trigger was actuated then:
      {ul
      {- [linger_ns w < delay_ns w] the tick was in advance.}
      {- [linger_ns w = delay_ns w] the tick was on time.}
      {- [linger_ns w > delay_ns w] the tick was late.}} *)

  val delay_ns : t -> span_ns
  (** [delay_ns w] is [w]'s waiting delay. *)

  val trigger : t -> trigger
  (** [trigger w] is [w]'s trigger. *)

  val fold : ('a -> t -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a
  (** [fold f acc] folds over all watchers that have {!waiting }[ t = true]. *)
end

(** The type for clock tick watchers with triggers as functions.

    [WATCHER_FUN] is like {!WATCHER} but defines {!trigger}s
    as functions in which you get the the watcher. *)
module type WATCHER_FUN = sig

  (** {1 Function triggers} *)

  type t
  (** The type for suspension reliable watchers. *)

  type trigger = t -> unit
  (** The type for suspension reliable triggers. *)

  include WATCHER with type t := t and type trigger := trigger
end

(** {1 Unreliable ticking} *)

(**  Unreliable, monotonic, clock tick watchers.

    [Make_unreliable] has the following properties. Given a watcher
    [w]:
    {ul
    {- If there is no {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event while
       {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true]. The value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.}
    {- Watcher triggers being {{!WATCHER_FUN.trigger}functions} they are not
       persisted and do not survive
       a {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} event.}}

    These properties are typically sufficient for watching small timeouts
    in protocol implementations. *)
module Make_unreliable (M : MCLOCK) (MT : MTICK) : WATCHER_FUN

(** {1 Best-effort ticking} *)

(** Best-effort, program suspension resistant, monotonic, clock tick
    watchers.

    Given a watcher [w]:
    {ul
    {- If there is no {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event while
       {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true], the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.}
    {- If there is one or more pairs of {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and
       {!LIFECYCLE.resume} events while {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true]
       and that the difference between the value of {!PCLOCK.now_d_ps}
       at these events provides an accurate measure of the actual wall-clock
       time span that elapsed during suspension, the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.

       This condition is typically satisfied if {!PCLOCK} is well synchronized
       at {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and {!LIFECYCLE.resume} and no leap second
       occurs between these two events. The absolute value of {!PCLOCK} doesn't
       matter.}
    {- Watcher triggers being {{!WATCHER_FUN.trigger}functions} they are not
       persisted and do not survive
       a {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} event.}} *)
module Make_suspension_resistant : functor
(P : PCLOCK) (M : MCLOCK) (MT : MTICK) (E : LIFECYCLE) -> WATCHER_FUN

(** The type for persistent triggers.

    [PERSISTENT_TRIGGER] provides a type that tick watchers are able
    to actuate and to serialize. *)
module type PERSISTENT_TRIGGER = sig

  (** {1 Triggers} *)

  type t
  (** The type for persistent triggers. *)

  val actuate : int64 -> int64 -> t -> unit
  (** [actuate d t tr] is called whenever a watcher's trigger needs to
      be actuated. [d] is the watcher's delay and [t] the actual
      lingering time. *)

  val codec : (t -> string) * (string -> (t, R.msg) result)
  (** [codec] is a byte codec for triggers. *)
end

(** Best-effort, program poweroff resistant, monotonic, clock tick
    watchers.

    Given a watcher [w]:
    {ul
    {- If there is no {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} event while
       {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true], the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.}
    {- If there is one or more pairs of {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and
       {!LIFECYCLE.resume} events while {!WATCHER.waiting}[ w] is [true]
       and that the difference between the value of {!PCLOCK.now_d_ps}
       at these events provides an accurate measure of the actual wall-clock
       time span that elapsed during suspension, the value of
       {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and exact wall-clock time
       span.

       This condition is typically satisfied if {!PCLOCK} is well synchronized
       at {!LIFECYCLE.suspend} and {!LIFECYCLE.resume} and no leap second
       occurs between these two events. The absolute value of {!PCLOCK} doesn't
       matter.}
    {- If there is one or more pairs of {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} and
       {!LIFECYCLE.poweron} events and that the difference between
       the value of {!PCLOCK.now_d_ps} at these events provides an accurate
       measure of the actual wall-clock time span that elapsed during the
       poweroff, the value of {!WATCHER.linger_ns}[ w] is an accurate and
       exact wall-clock time span.

       This condition is typically satisfied if {!PCLOCK} is well synchronized
       at {!LIFECYCLE.poweroff} and {!LIFECYCLE.poweron} and no leap second
       occurs between these two events. The absolute value of {!PCLOCK} doesn't
       matter.}}
    In this interface triggers can be {{!PERSISTENT_TRIGGER}persisted}.
    Note that trigger actuation occurs through the {!PERSISTENT_TRIGGER}
    interface. *)
